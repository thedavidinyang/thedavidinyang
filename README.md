I have a strong enthusiasm for growth and a keen interest in developing enterprise systems while enjoying the process. Currently, I am seeking opportunities to collaborate on engaging and challenging projects. 

My background includes a proven track record in the information technology and services industry, where I have gained experience in constructing web applications specifically designed for small, medium and large sized businesses. 

My expertise lies in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Software Development using JavaScript, MySQL, and Php. My core  technologies are not limited to but include Jquery, Laravel, Wordpress, Moodle, Vuejs Bootstrap, SAASS, SCSS, Joomla .

As a software developer, I am experienced and growth driven, motivated, intelligent, passionate, hard-working, and receptive to new ideas. I would be a valuable asset to any team.
